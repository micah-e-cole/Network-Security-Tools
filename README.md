# Network-Security-Tools
In an ongoing learning endeavor, I have been learning tools for Network and IT Security. One tool I found difficult to obtain in my own case (using Kali Linux on a virtual machine) was Linux tools to directly read/translate wtmp logs for Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR). 

I created this graphical user interface (GUI) that can aid the user in selecting the wtmp file and translating the binary file into human readable text using the Python, tkinter, and C.

Note: This project is still under development. I am working on testing things in the Linux environment and adding the functionality of a bash script to install dependencies and compile the C file ahead of time.
